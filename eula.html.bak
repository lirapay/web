that the Application, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on
behalf of Lirapay are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware,
time bombs or other harmful components.<br>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied
warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to

          <br><b>Limitation of Liability</b>
          <br>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of

exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount
actually paid by you for the Application.<br>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Lirapay or
its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential
damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits,
for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal
injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of
or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or third-party

of this Agreement), even if Lirapay or any supplier has been advised of the
possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential
purpose.<br>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to you.<br>

that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or
power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right
granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any
applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall
govern.<br>
